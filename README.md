ADU vs accesory building

### What is an accesory building?
https://library.municode.com/ca/contra_costa_county/codes/ordinance_code?nodeId=TIT8ZO_DIV82GERE_CH82-4DE_82-4.212BUAC
```
82-4.212 - Building, accessory.

"Accessory building" is a building the use and size of which is subordinate and incidental to that of a main building on the same lot. In addition, no accessory building shall exceed:

(1)

Five hundred square feet of floor area coverage on lots less than twenty thousand square feet in area and six hundred square feet of floor area coverage on lots greater than twenty thousand square feet in area;

(2)

Fifteen feet in height. 
```

##### Conclusion: I do not see any definition of an accesory building that includes any descriptors besides sq footage or height

### Accesory building yard percentage

```
82-14.006 - Accessory uses in rear yards.

An accessory building or accessory use may occupy not more than thirty percent of a required rear yard.

(Prior code § 8117: Ord. 382).
```

## Setbacks
### Street facing setbacks
We are a corner lot in R-10 district
https://library.municode.com/ca/contra_costa_county/codes/ordinance_code?nodeId=TIT8ZO_DIV84LAUSDI_CH84-8R-SIMIREDI_84-8.1004YAET
```
84-8.1004 - Yard—Setback.

Setback (front yard) provisions for the R-10 district shall be the same as those for the R-6 district (Section 84-4.1004).
```

Now here is the regulation for R-6:https://library.municode.com/ca/contra_costa_county/codes/ordinance_code?nodeId=TIT8ZO_DIV84LAUSDI_CH84-4SIMIREDI_ART84-4.6LO_84-4.1004YAET
```
84-4.1004 - Yard—Setback.

There shall be a setback (front yard) of at least twenty feet for any structure in the R-6 district. On corner lots the principal frontage shall have a setback of at least twenty feet and the other setback shall be at least fifteen feet.
```
##### Conclusion: we are definitely well over 20 ft from property line from front, and well over 15 ft from property line on side

### Side setback
This would be our neighbor to the right. For R-10 district: https://library.municode.com/ca/contra_costa_county/codes/ordinance_code?nodeId=TIT8ZO_DIV84LAUSDI_CH84-8R-SIMIREDI_84-8.1002YAID
```
84-8.1002 - Yard—Side.

There shall be an aggregate side yard width of at least twenty feet. No side yard shall be less than ten feet wide. These minima may be reduced to three feet for an accessory building or structure if it is set back at least fifty feet from the front property line.
```

##### Conclusion: Reduced to 3 feet if within 50 feet of FRONT property line, which is true

### Rear setback
This would be neighbor "behind" us on Center st

For district R-10, we are same regulations as R-6: https://library.municode.com/ca/contra_costa_county/codes/ordinance_code?nodeId=TIT8ZO_DIV84LAUSDI_CH84-8R-SIMIREDI_84-8.1002YAID
```
84-8.1006 - Yard—Rear.

Rear yard provisions for the R-10 district shall be the same as those for the R-6 district (Section 84-4.1006).
```

What does R-6 say? https://library.municode.com/ca/contra_costa_county/codes/ordinance_code?nodeId=TIT8ZO_DIV84LAUSDI_CH84-4SIMIREDI_ART84-4.6LO_84-4.1006YAEA
```
84-4.1006 - Yard—Rear.

There shall be a rear yard for any principal structure of at least fifteen feet. There shall be a rear yard for accessory structures of at least three feet.
```

#### Conclusion: 3 ft setback for accesory structure on the rear
